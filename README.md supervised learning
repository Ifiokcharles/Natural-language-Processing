Take five different samples of Gutenberg digital books, that are of five different genres and authors, that are semantically different. Separate and set aside unbiased random partitions for training and test. 
1. Run the from line 1 to line 272.
2. Open "Error_locations" to assist with error analysis
3. At line 282, pick the misclassified document you want to analyze by using "mislocs[i]"
4. "i" is the index number in "Error_locations"
5. At line 287, pick the documents for the wrongly predicted author ("Misclassification" in
   "Error_locations")
author 0 = (0,200)
author 1 = (200,400)
author 2 = (400,600)
author 3 = (600,800)
author 4 = (800,1000)

6. At line 339, indicate documents for the false positive author and ensure documents
   matches documents in line 287.
7. Run code from line 273 to the end.
